# Parcial
#Strange order
The class Strange order give de number in the next order: For the entry that the user gives, we can determinate how many numbers 
the program needs print, if the number is five, we going to have a list with five number and the first number always is going to be 
the varible that the user give us. With a cycle the numbers are generated from highest to lowest, and with a Method of MCD by two numbers
of the list we going to enqueue, at the same time the number of the find index in the method it's going to be eliminated.

#Dual Issues
this class use a merge sort for order the numbers, 

#Zulu and alarm clock
in this class uses the arrays like main method, to get the numbers of the clocks that the user index, and his alarms, with a conditionals for the hours, minutes, and seconds, if I decrease or increase some of this, in one unit , to obtain the less value or to lower cost to program the alarms, when the clocks and alarm given complete the conditionals, the last step is check the possibilities and sum the two differences of the most optables clocks.

#Micro's house
method is to go through all the submatrices and find xor off all the elements in that submatrix. we start with all methods, one od them is find de max value of the submatrix. calling the other two methods one of them insert the values by connections (all of this operations was with bits operators), for operate we uses all operators with XOR if the resul is = 0 or = 1 and comparates for add an index. then in the main we for each array we will find out value of the maximum xor subarray, and finally find out maximum of all those.
