# Parcial
#Strange order
The class Strange order give de number in the next order: For the entry that the user gives, we can determinate how many numbers 
the program needs print, if the number is five, we going to have a list with five number and the first number always is going to be 
the varible that the user give us. With a cycle the numbers are generated from highest to lowest, and with a Method of MCD by two numbers
of the list we going to enqueue, at the same time the number of the find index in the method it's going to be eliminated.

#Dual Issues
this class use a merge sort for order the prime numbers more easy and a method for find the prime numbers use the mod operator. Then when find the two last numbers we multiplicate both, if we find just one, we multiplicate the highest number for him self
And that is the return of the program.

#Zulu and alarm clock
in this class uses the arrays like main method, to get the numbers of the clocks that the user index, and his alarms, with a conditionals for the hours, minutes, and seconds, if I decrease or increase some of this, in one unit , to obtain the less value or to lower cost to program the alarms, when the clocks and alarm given complete the conditionals, the last step is check the possibilities and sum the two differences of the most optables clocks.

#Micro's house
method is to go through all the submatrix and find xor off all the elements in that submatrix. we start with all methods, one od them is find de max value of the submatrix. calling the other two methods one of them insert the values by connections (all of this operations was with bits operators), for operate we uses all operators with XOR if the resul is = 0 or = 1 and comparates for add an index. then in the main we for each array we will find out value of the maximum xor subarray, and finally find out maximum of all those.

#Decreasing max partitioning
I work with arrays and with operator mod for divide or patitioning the array en find the numbers thath i can divide the array, one of the
conditional is the first number that the user index it's going to be the fisr in the partitioning, another condition is the second number of the partition must be less than the first and consecutively. 

#Zulu and Games
with a list we going to enqueue the numbers, and if the pair of numbers intersect with another pair will not count as a possible power, if the pairs of numbers do not intersect, the values will be added.

#Army Parade
the program consists of looking for all the possibilities that there is to send the military to the specified work, the process that is done is given a matrix of n * m will begin with a sub-matrix of 2 x 2 to find how many official there is in that division, that will be 
the amount of possibilities of sending soldiers for said sub matrix, the possibilities end when we read all matrix. The officers found al the end are going to be add.
